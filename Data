📌 Slide 1: Title Slide – Federated Learning with Unity Catalog

Title: Global AI Strategy – Federated Learning with Unity Catalog
Subtitle: Ensuring Data Sovereignty, Compliance & AI Collaboration Across Azure Regions

Key Points (Bullet List):

🌍 Why Federated Learning?

Ensures data sovereignty by keeping raw data within its region.

Reduces cross-region data transfer costs while improving global AI models.

Supports collaborative AI without compromising compliance (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.).


🔹 Role of Unity Catalog

Centralized metadata & governance across multiple Azure regions.

Enables secure AI model tracking, RBAC-based access control, and lineage tracking.

Facilitates cross-region AI model sharing while enforcing security policies.


🚀 Key Benefits

Scalable & Cost-Efficient AI Training without moving raw data.

Improved Model Accuracy using insights from multiple regions.

Seamless Integration with Azure Services (Synapse, Purview, ADLS, Databricks).



📌 Next Slide: Proposed Federated Learning Architecture with Unity Catalog

📌 Slide 2: Architecture Diagram – Federated Learning with Unity Catalog

🎯 Title: Proposed Architecture for Federated Learning Using Unity Catalog

Diagram (To be placed in the slide):
✔ Per Country AI Training:

Each country has its own Databricks Unity Catalog managing data stored in ADLS Gen2.

Local AI models are trained within each Azure region.


✔ Federated Learning Model Aggregation:

AI models are trained locally, and only model parameters (not raw data) are shared.

A Central Federated Learning Server aggregates the models in a neutral Azure region.


✔ Global AI Governance with Unity Catalog:

Unity Catalog tracks model lineage across all Azure regions.

Azure Purview ensures compliance & governance.


✔ Model Deployment & Insights:

The global AI model is deployed via Azure Kubernetes (AKS) or Databricks Model Serving.

Power BI & Azure Synapse provide insights from the federated model.


📌 Key Takeaway: This architecture enables global AI collaboration while ensuring data sovereignty, governance, and compliance.
